**Ceremony lighting for Tau Beta Pi**

This repo holds the documentation for the Tau Beta Pi ceremony lighting revamp created by Erik Haag in Fall 2021. The main purpose of the project was to modernize some of the less-than-savory, officially sponsored hacks that were used to make the original system "safe". Main highlights include:
  * Moving from a mains-powered incandescent lamp to an LED lamp powered from low voltage DC
  * Improving the durability of the system through improved connectors, strain reliefs, and other parts
  * Custom PCB including overvoltage, reverse voltage, and overcurrent protection

The content here consists primarily of two sections. First, the user manual (i.e., the Wiki in the tab above) contains the basic information needed to operate the lighting system. Honestly, it's really pretty simple. There are lots of pictures. Don't be afraid. The other section pertains to the custom PCB that was designed for this project. It includes a schematic, a bill of materials, an assembly drawing, the KiCad project files, and the Gerbers for the board itself.

Finally, for any questions or concerns not explicitly addressed by the documents contained in this repository, please feel free to use the issue tracker associated with this repository. I have also included my U of M email address on the inside of the control unit's cover, in case I happen to miss anything here.
